# Frontend SalesForce Developer at HelloBuild.

This is a test for candidates applying as a Frontend SalesForce Developer at HelloBuild.

1. Edit any page in Salesforce and add a component where we can see contacts list.
2. Create an LWC component called "ContactList" that fetches a list of Contacts from
Salesforce and displays them in a table format. The component should have the
following requirements:
-The component should be able to handle errors and display an error message if the data
fetch fails.
-Each row in the table should display the Contact's Name, Email, and Phone fields.
-Use the "Contact" object in Salesforce's standard schema for retrieving the data.
-Implement proper error handling and data loading indicators if necessary.
If you want you can use flows or apex to get data
